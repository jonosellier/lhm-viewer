	maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
	preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

	
We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on
	our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements,
	to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders
	(depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their
	technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may
	appear either on our Services or on other websites. To the extent these online tracking
	technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined
	under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online
	tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES
	RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?" Specific information about how we use such technologies
	and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
	

	Google Analytics We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of
	the Services. The Google Analytics Advertising Features that we may use include: Google Display Network
	Impressions Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interests Reporting. To opt out of being
	tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You
	can opt out of Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings and Ad Settings for mobile
	apps. Other opt out means include http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice.
	For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms page.


	7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? In Short: We keep your information for as long as
	necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by
	law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
	set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
	(such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us
	keeping your personal information for longer than forty eight (48) months past the termination of
	the user's account.

	
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
	will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
	because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
	your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.


	8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? In Short: We aim to protect your personal information
	through a system of organizational and technical security measures. We have implemented
	appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
	security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
	secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
	technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
	cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
	improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
	protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services
	is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. 9. DO WE
	COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS? In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
	children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to
	children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the
	Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
	minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
	information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
	account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
	aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
	jonosellier@gmail.com. 10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

	
In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the
	European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that
	allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
	terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.


	In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under
	applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a
	copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
	processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to
	be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to
	object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting
	us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
	NOTICE?" below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data
	protection laws. If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
	your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data
	protection authority or UK data protection authority. If you are located in Switzerland, you may
	contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. Withdrawing your consent: If we
	are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or
	implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
	any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
	provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. However, please note
	that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
	applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
	reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. Account Information If you would at any
	time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
	Log in to your account settings and update your user account. Contact us using the contact
	information provided. Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete
	your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in
	our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our
	legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
	

	If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at jonosellier@gmail.com.
	11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

	
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
	Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
	have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
	technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
	do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
	communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
	that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
	this Privacy Notice. California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
	signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring
	DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. 12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC
	PRIVACY RIGHTS? In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,
	Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas,
	Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the
	personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get
	a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your
